## benchmarksv3
    - Contains all benchmarks in paper and some additional examples
    - "bsize-scripts" contains scripts for generating batch-oriented data.
    - "fault-scripts" contains scripts for generating fault-based data.
## drivers
    - `batchd` includes batch-based modifications
    - `faults` includes fault-based data
## tools
    - `syslogger` contains the tool for parsing data out of the system log
    - `plotv2` contains .sh scripts that operate the .py scripts for reproducing plots and analysis from the paper if data is available


## Swapping the driver
To enable logging information, the driver with added logging features must be installed. Additionally, it may
need certain parameters to function correctly. This requires root permission in most cases.\
There are two drivers provided. One collects produces "batch" experiment data from the paper, and the other produces
"fault" experiment data from the paper (access patterns). They are in ../drivers/batchd-NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.74.27.04/kernel/
and ../drivers/faults-NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-460.74.27.04/kernel/ respectively

### Build
cd drivers/*-NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.74.27.04/kernel/\
make modules\
sudo make modules_install

### Load
sudo rmmod nvidia_uvm\
sudo modprobe nvidia_uvm\
Note: turn on/off prefetching with 1/0 and/or maximum batch size\
sudo modprobe nvidia-uvm uvm_perf_prefetch_enable={1,0}\
sudo modprobe nvidia-uvm uvm_perf_fault_batch_count=${batch_size}

## Tools
Several tools are used to assist with data collection, as all data is logged to the system logger. dmesg is too slow in the event of page fault collection

### Syslogger
Move data from system log to file while application is running:\
tools/syslogger/log "$logfile"&\
pid=$!\
<path>/app\
kill $pid


### log2csv
Process syslogger output into CSV:\
tools/sys2csv/log2csv.sh $logfile

## Applications
The scripts will reproduce the experiments as they were performed for use in the paper, including data not used or omitted for space.\
We will document them in detail here:

## Data and Formatting
Check benchmarks/bsize-scripts and benchmarks/faults-scripts (batchd- driver and faults- driver respectively) 
for data layout, formatting as well as instructions for generating data from the paper.

## Plotting
Plots can be generated by files in the tools/plotv2 directory; refer to in-directory readme
